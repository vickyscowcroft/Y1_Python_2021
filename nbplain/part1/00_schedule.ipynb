    "While I'm assuming that you're reasonably comfortable with the material covered in Semester 1, we will be reviewing parts of it in the coming weeks. The best ways to improve your coding skills are to practice and to play around with things. Don't be scared of changing bits of code to see what happens - you can always change things back if they don't work and I'm not asking you to do anything that will seriously break something. "
